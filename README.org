This is an experiment to setup an Emacs Buddy mentoring to make Emacs
easier to learn. This means you can have an experienced somebody to
periodically contact for your Emacs struggles. See below section for more.

Here a list of people available as buddies:

** The idea in more detail

TL;DR: I see the buddy as a companion that you can have a creative
chat and that will try to help you to achieve Emacs enlightenment, not
your personal problem solver. (And I am not concerned about
scalability, because it is about creating a personal interaction
through our commonality: enjoying Emacs.)

This initiative is about making your learning of Emacs more personal.
An example of interaction I wish for:

**EmacsBuddy**: cool! You can find a great Org
> Mode tutorial here and there is also a Reddit channel there. I can

> any chance you have a trick for that?! -- continues --

So for me a buddy should nudge new users towards Emacs enlightenment
focusing on the why they started using Emacs. A forum or a mailing
list is more about solving a particular problem you have: the solution
of such problems should be visible to everybody and fit a public
forum. (Actually a great buddy would show their partner when is
appropriate to move a conversation from private to a public channel!)

If I use Emacs to keep track of my weird hobby, I may find it helpful
to get the point of view of my buddy on how to make the best out of my
editor for that. And I can also just start chatting about something
totally unrelated to the problem because I am enjoying the conversation.

Ideally you can make friends with the excuse!
