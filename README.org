This is an experiment to setup an Emacs Buddy mentoring to make Emacs
easier to learn. This means you can have an experienced somebody to
periodically contact for your Emacs struggles. See below section for more.

** Buddies

Here a list of people available as buddies.

If you want to contact one of the buddies below, ping me at [[mailto:andrea-dev@hotmail.com][my email
address]] and I will get you in touch.

*** Alessandro

I am happily learning vanilla Emacs. I use it for C/C++ development,
and org mode for writing prose and taking notes.
I am still learning, but I'm happy to help newbies like everyone of us once was.

*** Andrea

I use vanilla Emacs with an Org Mode literate configuration.
I like to automate boring tasks with Emacs Lisp.

*** Ihor

I use a heavily customized vanilla Emacs. Mostly using Org mode for research and
as personal GTD system.  I am contributing to Org mode project and thus speak
Elisp.  I also use Emacs to manage email (via =notmuch=), read RSS feeds (=elfeed=),
read books/articles in PDF (=pdf-tools=), and track my finances (=ledger-mode=).

TL;DR: I see the buddy as a companion that you can have a creative
chat and that will try to help you to achieve Emacs enlightenment, not
your personal problem solver. (And I am not concerned about
scalability, because it is about creating a personal interaction
through our commonality: enjoying Emacs.)

This initiative is about making your learning of Emacs more personal.
An example of interaction I wish for:

#+begin_src verbatim
**EmacsUserLookingForBuddy**: I am a physiotherapist, I struggle
keeping track of my clients and they told me Org Mode is a great
tool for that. I started with Emacs tutorial, but now how can I
handle my clients??


**EmacsBuddy**: cool! You can find a great Org
Mode tutorial here and there is also a Reddit channel there. I can
help you better if you tell me some more about what is your struggle
with clients? For example, you struggle keeping track of
communication or timetable or ....? By the way, I got a back pain:
any chance you have a trick for that?! -- continues --
#+end_src

So for me a buddy should nudge new users towards Emacs enlightenment
focusing on the why they started using Emacs. A forum or a mailing
list is more about solving a particular problem you have: the solution
of such problems should be visible to everybody and fit a public
forum. (Actually a great buddy would show their partner when is
appropriate to move a conversation from private to a public channel!)

If I use Emacs to keep track of my weird hobby, I may find it helpful
to get the point of view of my buddy on how to make the best out of my
editor for that. And I can also just start chatting about something
totally unrelated to the problem because I am enjoying the conversation.

Ideally you can make friends with the excuse!
