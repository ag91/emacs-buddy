This is an experiment to setup an Emacs Buddy mentoring to make Emacs
easier to learn. This means you can have an experienced somebody to
periodically contact for your Emacs struggles. See below section for more.

Here a list of people available as buddies:

|             | I write about all things Zettelkasten in Emacs for my blogs.                          | https://zettelkasten.de                                  |
|             | Using =notmuch= for email, so I'm moving a lot of tasks into Emacs.                   |                                                          |

|             | I use it mostly to program, professionally and as a hobby, and as a note-taking tool. |                                                          |

| George      | I've used Emacsen since before GNU (starting on TECO/TOPS20),                         | [[http://git.galthub.com:3000/gmj/home.public.emacs.d/src/master/.emacs.d/george.org][George's literate Emacs configuration]]                    |
|             | but let's get one thing straight, nobody every "arrives" in Emacs.                    |                                                          |
|             | I'm here to learn as well.   Emacs and Org-mode are the base of my grand plan         |                                                          |
|             | to integrate infosec, hiking, Latin, philosophy, TODO lists.....                      |                                                          |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| Robert      | My main areas of expertise are: emoji, Unicode, some Org Mode, Gnus,                  |                                                          |
|             | Emacs internals (networking/subrpocess), documentation.                               |                                                          |
|             | I wonʼt claim to be the worldʼs greatest elisp programmer,                            |                                                          |
|             | but I can normally help people out with the basics.                                   |                                                          |

| David       | I've been using Emacs for various tasks for 18 years                                  | https://www.youtube.com/@davidotoole3296/videos          |
|             | and would be happy to help out people of any skill level.                             |                                                          |

|             | simple tools and few external dependencies. The same rule applies when it comes       |                                                          |
|             | down to personal usage.                                                               |                                                          |
|             | Recently have been selective and thoughtful about what I use. Want to become a        |                                                          |
|             | mature Emacs user: have a deep understanding of Emacs itself and the core packages,   |                                                          |
|             | and most importantly, becomes the master of Emacs, not the slave.                     |                                                          |
|             | Willing to buy you a coffee at any time to discuss "how to utilise Emacs to           |                                                          |
|             | become a better learner." Two if you are a quant as well.                             |                                                          |

** The idea in more detail

TL;DR: I see the buddy as a companion that you can have a creative
chat and that will try to help you to achieve Emacs enlightenment, not
your personal problem solver. (And I am not concerned about
scalability, because it is about creating a personal interaction
through our commonality: enjoying Emacs.)

This initiative is about making your learning of Emacs more personal.
An example of interaction I wish for:

#+begin_src verbatim
**EmacsUserLookingForBuddy**: I am a physiotherapist, I struggle
keeping track of my clients and they told me Org Mode is a great
tool for that. I started with Emacs tutorial, but now how can I
handle my clients??


**EmacsBuddy**: cool! You can find a great Org
Mode tutorial here and there is also a Reddit channel there. I can
help you better if you tell me some more about what is your struggle
with clients? For example, you struggle keeping track of
communication or timetable or ....? By the way, I got a back pain:
any chance you have a trick for that?! -- continues --
#+end_src

So for me a buddy should nudge new users towards Emacs enlightenment
focusing on the why they started using Emacs. A forum or a mailing
list is more about solving a particular problem you have: the solution
of such problems should be visible to everybody and fit a public
forum. (Actually a great buddy would show their partner when is
appropriate to move a conversation from private to a public channel!)

If I use Emacs to keep track of my weird hobby, I may find it helpful
to get the point of view of my buddy on how to make the best out of my
editor for that. And I can also just start chatting about something
totally unrelated to the problem because I am enjoying the conversation.

Ideally you can make friends with the excuse!
